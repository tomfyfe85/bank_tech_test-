// This separation of concerns needs to be applied. 
// IE create Date class as separate module

// Use NewDate as module in the Account class
// Tests should pass
// UNIT Write withdrawal test/function 

//UPDATE INT TEST TO EXPECT NEW STRING RESULTS IN STATEMENT

Statement class must return data from other dates in correct order.
Statement class must have a header at the top and not be repeated in
the same instance
New data should be entered in reverse order. 

// INT TEST header appears last in array
// INT TEST data is presented in reverse order
