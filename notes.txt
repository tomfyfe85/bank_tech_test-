// This separation of concerns needs to be applied. 
// IE create new Transaction class and Date class as separate modules
// Complete "returns date, amount deposited, new balance" test in Account.js

Date- 
create new date class module
//UNIT TEST Date

Account & Transaction classes
remove deposit and withdraw from account. Make a Transaction class.
// INT TEST account/transaction/date


Statement class must return data from other dates in correct order.
Statement class must have a header at the top and not be repeated in
the same instance
New data should be entered in reverse order. 

// INT TEST header appears last in array
// INT TEST data is presented in reverse order
